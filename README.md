    print(file)
```

Create a directory
```python
gdrive.mkdir("/Books")
```

Create even more directories
```python
gdrive.mkdir("/Books/Science")
gdrive.mkdir("/Books/Litterature")
gdrive.mkdir("/Books/Science/Programming/JAVA")
gdrive.mkdir("/Books/Science/Programming/Python/3/")
```
Remove files and directories
```python
# move to Trash
gdrive.rm("/Books/Science/Programming/JAVA")
# delete permanently
gdrive.rm("/Books/Litterature", permanently=True)
```
Download a file

gdrive.download("/Books/Science/physics.pdf", "/home/user/Downloads/physics.pdf")
```
Upload a file
```python
gdrive.upload("/home/user/Videos/mrbean.mp4", "/Videos/mrbean.mp4")
```
Check if a file exists
```python
gdrive.exists("/path/to/file")
```
